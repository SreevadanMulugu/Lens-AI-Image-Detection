**Lens: AI Image Detection**

Lens: AI Image Detection is a GUI application designed to determine whether an image was generated by AI image generators. This project operates entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy and security. It requires a CUDA GPU (Nvidia GPU) for optimal performance.

**Transformers should be 4.39.2**

**Features**

1. **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - Drag and drop images or upload them via a file dialog.
    
2. **AI Image Detection**:
    - Analyze images to determine if they were generated by AI.
    
3. **Result Display**:
    - Display results along with the uploaded image.
    
4. **Local Processing**:
    - Runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy and security.

**Unique Aspects**

1. **Few Open Source Vision Models**:
    - Limited open-source vision models like Llava 1.6, 1.5, Phi-3-vision, and closed-source models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude.
    
2. **Performance**:
    - While the best open-source models comparable to Gemini and Claude fail at determining if an image is AI-generated, only GPT-4 and Claude provide logical answers.
    
3. **Advanced Models Limitations**:
    - GPT-4 and Claude have message limitations, reaching up to 4-5 images per account limit.
    
4. **Local and Limitless**:
    - The project stands out because it is fully local with no limits, and it uses a smaller model compared to the closed-source models.
